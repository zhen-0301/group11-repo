#### TL;DR
Due date: **Monday 2pm Week 5**\
Submission artefacts:
- Project Proposal
- User Research Report
- Information Architecture
- Low-Fidelity Wireframes

## Requirements
You will prepare a Markdown (for Markdown syntax, see this [linked page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)) report that identifies a clear purpose for the website, demonstrates an understanding of who the target users are, define the scope and structure of the website, and create initial low-fidelity designs.  This will be the initial plan for the website you will implmenent in the next phase of the assignment.\
The report your create will be the output generated from the user research activities that you and your team members execute.

### Deliverables
#### Project Proposal
- **Website concept**: clearly articulate the website's purpose, the problem it solves, or the opportunity it addresses.
- **Target audeience profile**: describe your primary target audience in detail.
- **Scope statement**: outline the key features and content areas planned for the website, including a brief mention of any simple backend functionalities envisioned (e.g., "a contact form that stores messages", "a small gallery pulling images and descriptions from a database").

#### User Research Report
- **Research methods**: describe the methods used to understand the target audience (e.g., surveys, interviews, competitor analysis).
- **User personas** (minimum 2): create at least two detailed user personas representing key segments of your target audience.  Each persona shold include:
    - Name, demographics, photo.
    - Goals, motivations, and needs relevant to the website.
    - Technical profieciency and typical device usage.
    - A brief scenario illustrating how they might interact with the proposed website.
- **Competitor analysis**: identify and analyse 2-3 existing websites or applications that are similar or address a related need.  Discuss their strengths, weaknesses, and key features.

#### Information Architecture
- **Sitemap**: a visual diagram illustrating the hierarchical structure of the website, showing all main pages and their relationships.
- **User flow diagram** (minimum 3): a diagram illustrating the path a typical user would take to complete a key task on your website (e.g., finding specific information, submitting a contact form).

#### Low-fidelity wireframes
> [!TIP]
> Focus on layout, content hierarchy, navigation, and placement of key interactive elements.  **Do not include colours, specific fonts, or details imagery at this stage.**
- **Wireframes**: digitally created using Figma for at least 5 key pages/screens of your website.  Include brief annotations to explain design choices, functionality, and content palceholders, noting where backend interaction might occur. *Your wireframes should cover the breadth of possible pages and interaction elements for your site.* 
- **Storyboard**: digitally created using Figma to demonstrate the screens and interactions that a user would work through to complete key tasks (minimum of five storyboards).
    - 2 simple storyboards (incorporates 3-5 wireframes)
    - 3 complex storyboards (incorporates 6+ wireframes)

### Learning Outcomes
The User Research and Low Fidelity Design submission addresses the following topic learning outcomes:
1. Determine how human factor principles and system design affects usability
2. Implement user focused software solutions through the effective inclusion of users in the design and development process
3. ~~Construct an evaluation procedure utilising the techniques of heuristic evaluations, usability testing and experimental evaluation~~
4. Reflect on ethical, legal and security issues related to web applications
5. Work independently and in a team on designing, creating and maintaining applications for the web
6. Communicate effectively, using technical language with other IT professionals

### Assessment and Submission
Your submission will be assessed on the quality and completeness of the document, the comprehensive consideration for the various components and proposed site structures, as well as your creativity and the ability to document a believable user persona, and present effective designs for page elements of your site. The document should be visually appealing and engaging, remember that these types of documents are intended to be visible and motivate the team to engage with their intended users.

#### Marking Rubric
| Criteria | HD (85-100%) | DN (75-84%) | CR (65-74%) | P (50-64%) | F (0-49%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project Proposal Clarity and Feasibility (25%) | Exceptionally clear, innovative concept. Goals are strategic. Deep audience understanding. Scope, including backend, is perfectly aligned. | Insightful concept, highly relevant goals, detailed audience profile, and well-justified scope including thoughtful backend integration ideas. | Clear concept, well-defined SMART goals, clear audience profile, and appropriate scope including basic backend considerations. | Basic concept, goals, audience, and scope are present but lack detail or strong justification. Brief mention of backend if applicable. | Concept is vague, goals unclear, audience ill-defined. Scope unrealistic, missing, or ignores potential backend. |
|User Research and Personas (25%) | Exemplary user research. Personas are exceptionally well-crafted and provide profound insights. Sophisticated competitor analysis. | Thorough user research. Personas are detailed, empathetic, and clearly drive design thinking. Insightful competitor analysis. | Good user research methods applied. Personas are well-developed and informative. Competitor analysis is adequate. | Basic user research conducted. Personas present but lack depth. Basic competitor analysis. | Minimal or no user research. Personas are superficial, missing, or irrelevant. Competitor analysis weak/absent. |
| Information Architecture and User Flow (25%) | Exceptionally clear, intuitive IA. Sitemap is comprehensive. User flow demonstrates deep task understanding including backend interactions. | Well-structured, comprehensive sitemap. User flow is logical and detailed for a key task, potentially showing backend steps. | Basic sitemap and user flow submitted; may have some structural issues or lack clarity. | Sitemap/User Flow missing, illogical, or very incomplete. Structure is confusing.|
| Low-Fidelity Wireframes and Annotations (25%) | Professional, highly effective wireframes. Annotations are insightful. Excellent communication of layout and core functionality, including backend considerations. | Detailed, well-organised wireframes for all key screens. Thoughtful annotations explaining rationale, including backend touchpoints. Strong structural design. | Clear wireframes for most key screens with adequate annotations. Layout is generally logical. Annotations may hint at backend. | Basic wireframes for some key screens. Layout is rudimentary. Annotations are minimal. | Wireframes missing, poorly executed, or do not represent key screens. Annotations absent or unhelpful. |

The work you submit should adhere to the guidelines presented here.\
Late submission of your work will incur a 5% penalty of the total marks possible per day (or part thereof) late.  Submission will not be accepted 5 days after the due date.\
The User Research and Low Fidelity Design Report is worth 25% of the overall marks for the topic.

### Academic Integrity Advisory
<img src="../../.AI-Images/Gen-AI-Icon-0002.png" alt="AI Assessment Scale indicating a level of AI-Assisted Idea Generation & Structuring." title="AI Assessment Scale indicating a level of AI-Assisted Idea Generation & Structuring." width="600"/>

For this assessment task, students can use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the development of their submission. Students are permitted to use AI to brainstorm ideas or provide ideas on structuring of documents. They cannot create written content using AI (e.g. sentences, paragraphs, etc.). Students are required to provide AI prompts used and drafts of their work and acknowledge how they used AI in their final submission.

#### How should the use of AI be acknowledged in the assessment task?
Students must submit a separate document with their video pitch.  The document should provide a declaration acknowledging which AI technologies have been used and how.  Drafts should be kept demonstrating authorship and may be requested by assessors. An appendix containing all prompts and output generated from AI should be included with the final submission.

For example: 
- I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT in the early stages of brainstorming the research ideas for this project (OpenAI, Year). The prompts and output from ChatGPT are included in Appendix A.

A reference to the use of AI should be included in the reference list. 

For example:
- (Year). ChatGPT (Month, Year, Version) [Large language model]. https://<!--comments-->chat.openai.<!--comment-->com/chat

**Academic Integrity**\
The misuse of generative AI or the failure to acknowledge the use of generative AI will be considered a breach of [Academic Integrity](https://students.flinders.edu.au/my-course/academic-integrity).

All work submitted should be the work of the authors, unless appropriately cited. Claiming work that is not your own is a breach of the Universityâ€™s Academic Integrity Policy and suspected breaches will be reviewed and reported where appropriate. Penalties for breaches can range from 0 marks for the assignment, 0 marks for the topic, or expulsion from the University.
